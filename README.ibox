As of today, 10-17-2003, there is no need for the ibox kernel-module
to send BREAK to the Intellibox. The init is now done directly in the
server (ib.c: sendBreak()), both for FBSD and Linux in the same
manner.

The old README.ibox is preserved in ibox/README if anyone has the need
to still use the kernel-driver (old code commented out in ib.c).
