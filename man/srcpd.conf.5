srcpd.conf \- The configuration file for the srcpd deamon
.\"
.\"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file \fI/etc/srcpd.conf\fP is used by the \fB srcpd (8)\fP.
This file contains the runtime configuration for the deamon
and it's connection(s) to model railroad system.
See
.BR srcpd\ (8)
for instruction how to use the daemon.
.\"

.SH "DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE"

.PP
The default file is shipped as with the srcpd and contains both
default settings and an example bus configuration.

.SH "FILE FORMAT"

.PP
The configuration file for srcpd is stored in XML format. As XML
files are plain text, experienced users can manipulate such files with
the help of a text editor. Less experienced users should select an
external configuration tool to ensure a syntactically correct format.
.PP
If there are errors during configuration file reading the daemon will
send appropriate notifications to the syslog daemon. These messages can
be watched using the \fI/var/log/messages\fP file.
.PP
Currently there is no document type definition (DTD) available, to
validate the format of a user created configuration file.
.PP
Each configuration file must contain the following base structure:

.nf
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <srcpd>
    ...
    </srcpd>
.fi

.PP
Within this structure (...) the necessary busses are configured, each
using a separate substructure:
.PP
.nf
    <bus>
    ...
    </bus>
    <bus>
    ...
    </bus>
.fi
.\"
.\"
.SS General hints
.PP
The first configured bus should allways be the server-bus. Sequence and
number of the following buses are any desired. Only buses that are
actually used with the daemon should be filed. Not used buses can be
commented out:
.PP
.nf
    <!--
    <bus>
    ...
    </bus>
    -->
.fi

.PP
Please bear in mind the numbering of the following buses will be changed
accordingly.
.\"
.\"
.SS Universal options
.PP
The following options are usable for all used bus sections.
.\"
.TP
verbosity
Depending on this number (valid range: 0..5) the bus will tell you less
or more about what is happening. The 0 value gives a minimum output.
This option is mainly used for debugging reasons. You can watch these
messages using the syslog daemon file \fI/var/log/messages\fP; see
\fBsrcpd\ (8)\fP for more informations.
.\"
.TP
use_watchdog
Some buses provide a watchdog feature to cancel a blocked bus thread.
Valid input values are \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. The default value is
\fBno\fR.
.\"
.TP

value is \fI/dev/null\fR.
.\"
.TP
auto_power_on
This option enables/disables automatical power on for a bus on server
daemon start.  This option
is not necessary for \fBserver\fP and \fBloopback\fP buses. The default
value is \fBno\fR.
.\"
.TP

via the serial port. An USB2Serial converter should work fine. The serial
line settings are fixed to 9600\ baud and cannot be changed. Sum of all
feedback-modules must be less or equal to 31, otherwise you will get an
errormessage.
.TP
number_fb_left
HSI-88 has three lines for S88-bus. This value is number of feedback-modules
(with 16 inputs) connected to line called left. If you use feedback-modules
with 8 inputs, 2 modules are counted as one.
.TP

.SS li100, li100usb
.PP
This driver connects with the LI100, LI100F, LI101F or LI-USB devices from
Lenz connected via the serial port/USB-interface. An USB2Serial converter
should not be used. The serial line settings are depending on type of
interface. For LI-USB it's fixed to 57600\ baud with no chance to change.
Autodetection of serial port interface speed is currently under
construction. If connection fails, try restart of srcpd with an other
speed. Possible values are 9600\ baud, 19200\ baud, 38400\ baud,
57600\ baud and 115200\ baud, depending on your interface.
.TP
fb_delay_time_0
This is the time in milliseconds an feedback input must be zero, before
this value is delivered to clients. With this feature you can compensate
bad feedback in a specific range. The default value is 0\ ms.
.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA. Supported range is 0..1024. A value of 0 means no
GA available. Default is 99 (LI-USB 9999).
.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address. Supported range
is 0..9999. A value of 0 means no GL available. Default is 99 (LI-USB 9999).

.SS loopback
.PP
This bus does not connect to real hardware. It is used primarily
for development tasks but may be useful for real installations too.
Every command on this bus does only have an echo effect on the INFO
sessions. This device may be used as virtual device for communication
tasks.
.TP
number_ga
This is the maximal address number of Generic Accessory (GA) devices.
Default is 256.
.TP
number_gl
This number gives the maximum valid address number of the Generic
Locomotive (GL) devices. Default is 80

.\"
.\"
.SS m605x
.PP
This supports communication with the 6051 or 6050 devices from Maerklin
connected via the serial port. An USB2Serial converter should work
fine. The serial line settings are fixed to 2400\ baud 8N2 and cannot
be changed.
.TP
m6020mode
In this mode the srcpd does not sent the 4 functions. This
is a feature of the 6021 only.
.TP
fb_delay_time_0
This is the time the driver code waits until it recognized the input
change in milliseconds. This feature may support a debounce found in
the hardware. The default value is 0\ ms.
.TP
ga_min_activetime
The time in milliseconds a GA device needs to be in active state. The
absolute minimum is 75\ ms and is needed for stable communication with
the 6051. The default value is 75\ ms.
.TP
pause_between_commands
This is the time between two commands the drivers must wait. The exact
values should be hand tuned. If the system does not respond or drops
commands try to increase this value. Default is 200\ ms.
.TP
pause_between_bytes
This is the time the driver waits between 2 bytes in multi-byte commands.
The hardware handshake does not work with all devices so this parameter
was introduced to support it. The default is 2\ ms.
.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA. This parameter does not have a real effect
since the interface supports the addresses 1..256 only. Keep the
default value 256 untouched.
.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum GL address. Since
this number is limited to 80, keep the default value 80 untouched.
.TP
number_fb
This is the number of 6088 modules attached to the 6051/6050 device.
The valid range is from 0..31. The default value is 0 (no modules are
attached). Please note that 6088 modules attached to other devices
(memory) cannot be accessed.
