.PP
The configuration file for srcpd is stored in XML format. As XML
files are plain text, experienced users can manipulate such files with
the help of a text editor. Less experienced users should select an
external configuration tool to ensure a syntactically correct format.
.\"
.PP
Currently there is no document type definition available, to validate the
format of a user created configuration file.

Each configuration file must contain the following structure:

.SH hsi-88
.\"
.PP
This driver connects with the HSI-88 device from Littfinski connected
via the serial port. An USB2Serial converter should work fine. The serial
line settings are fixed to 9600baud and cannot be changed. Sum of all
feedback-modules must be less or equal to 31, otherwise you will get an
errormessage.
.\"
.TP
number_fb_left
HSI-88 has three lines for S88-bus. This value is number of feedback-modules
(with 16 inputs) connected to line called left. If you use feedback-modules
with 8 inputs, 2 modules are counted as one.
.\"
.TP
number_fb_center
HSI-88 has three lines for S88-bus. This value is number of feedback-modules
(with 16 inputs) connected to line called center. If you use feedback-modules
with 8 inputs, 2 modules are counted as one.
.\"
.TP
number_fb_right
HSI-88 has three lines for S88-bus. This value is number of feedback-modules
(with 16 inputs) connected to line called right. If you use feedback-modules
with 8 inputs, 2 modules are counted as one.
.\"
.TP
fb_delay_time_0
This is the time an feedback input must be zero, before zero is delivered to
clients. Time is milliseconds. With this feature you can compensate bad
feedback in a specific range.
.\"
.TP
refresh
The time in microseconds after srcpd will read feedback from HSI-88.
.\"
.\"
.SH intellibox
.\"
.PP
This driver connects with the Intellibox device from Uhlenbrock connected
via the serial port. Only extended mode commands are used. Program of
decoders is currently implemented for DCC only.
Possible values for speed of serial port are 2400baud, 4800baud, 9600baud,
19200baud and 38400baud.
.\"
.TP
fb_delay_time_0
This is the time an feedback input must be zero, before zero is delivered to
clients. Time is milliseconds. With this feature you can compensate bad
feedback in a specific range.
.\"
.TP
pause_between_commands
This is the time between two commands the drivers must wait. The exact
values should be hand tuned. If the system does not respond or drops
commands try to increase this value. Default is 250 (milliseconds).
.\"
.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA. Supported range is 0..1024. A value of 0 means no
GA available.
Default is 256.
.\"
.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address. Supported range
is 0..10239. A value of 0 means no GL available.
Default is 80.
.\"
.TP
number_fb
This is the number of S88 modules attached to the Intellibox device.
It can be as large as 31. The default is 0 (no modules are attached).
Please note that Loconet is currently not supported.
.\"
.\"
.SH li100, li100usb
.\"
.PP
This driver connects with the LI100, LI100F, LI101F or LI-USB devices from
LENZ connected via the serial port/USB-interface. An USB2Serial converter
should not be used. The serial line settings are depending on type of
interface. For LI-USB it's fixed to 57600baud with no chance to change.
Autodetection of serial port interface speed is currently under
construction. If connection fails, try restart of srcpd with an other
speed. Possible values can be 9600baud, 19200baud, 38400baud, 57600baud and
115200baud (depending on your interface).
.\"
.TP
fb_delay_time_0
This is the time an feedback input must be zero, before zero is delivered to
clients. Time is milliseconds. With this feature you can compensate bad
feedback in a specific range.
.\"
.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA. Supported range is 0..1024. A value of 0 means no
GA available.
Default is 99 (LI-USB 9999).
.\"
.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address. Supported range
is 0..9999. A value of 0 means no GL available.
Default is 99 (LI-USB 9999).
.\"
.TP
number_fb
This is the number of RS modules attached to the Lenz device.
It can be as large as 512. It's assumed, that one modul has 8 inputs.
A value of 0 means no FB available.
Default is 256 (LI-USB 512).
.\"
.\"
.SH loopback
.\"
.PP
This bus does not connect to real hardware. It is used primarily
for development tasks but may be useful for real installations too.
Every command on this bus does only have an echo effect on the INFO
sessions. The devices may be used as virtual devices for communication
tasks.
.\"
.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA devices. Default is 256.
.\"
.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address.
Default is 80
.\"
.TP
number_fb
This is the number of feedback devices. Default is 0 (no device).
.\"
.\"
.SH m605x
.\"
.PP
This driver connects with the 6051 or 6050 devices from Marklin connected
via the serial port. An USB2Serial converter should work fine. The serial
line settings are fixed to 2400 8N2 and cannot be changed.
.\"
.TP
m6020mode
In this mode the srcpd does not sent the 4 functions. This
is a feature of the 6021 only.
.\"
.TP
p_time
This is the time the driver code waits until it recognized the input
change in milliseconds. This feature may support a debounce found in
the hardware.
.\"
.TP
ga_min_activetime
The time in milliseconds a GA device needs to be in active state. The
absolute minimum is 75 ms and is needed for stable communication with
the 6051.
.\"
.TP
pause_between_commands
This is the time between two commands the drivers must wait. The exact
values should be hand tuned. If the system does not respond or drops
commands try to increase this value. Default is 200 (milliseconds).
.\"
.TP
pause_between_bytes
This is the time the driver waits between 2 bytes in multi-byte commands.
The hardware handshake does not work with all devices so this parameter
was introduced to support it. The default is 2 (milliseconds)
.\"
.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA. This parameter does not have a real effect
since the interface supports the addresses 1...256 only. Keep the
default untouched.
.\"
.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address. Since this
number is limited to 80, keep the default untouched.
.\"
.TP
number_fb
This is the number of 6088 modules attached to the 6051/6050 device.
It can be as large as 31. The default is 0 (no modules are attached).
Please note that 6088 modules attached to other devices (memory)
cannot be accessed.
