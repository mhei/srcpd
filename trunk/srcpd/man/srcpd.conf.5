.TH srcpd.conf 5
.SH "NAME"
srcpd.conf \- The configuration file for the srcpd deamon
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file
.I /etc/srcpd.conf
is used by the 
.BR srcpd (8).
The file contains the runtime configuration for the deamon 
and it's connection(s) to model railroad systems.
See
.BR srcpd (8)
for instruction to use the daemon.

.SH "DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE"

.PP
The default file is shipped as with the srcpd and contains both
default settings and an example bus configuration.

.RS
.nf
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<srcpd version="2.0">
  <bus>
    <server>
      <tcp-port>4303</tcp-port>
      <pid-file>/var/run/srcpd.pid</pid-file>
      <username>nobody</username>
      <groupname>nogroup</groupname>

.SH "FILE FORMAT"

.PP
The configuration file for srcpd is stored in XML format. As XML
files are plain text, experienced users can manipulate such files with
the help of a text editor. Less experienced users should select an
external configuration tool to ensure a syntactically correct format.

.PP
Currently there is no document type definition available, to validate the
format of a user created configuration file.

.PP
Each configuration file must contain the following structure:

.nf
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <srcpd>
    ...
    </srcpd>
.fi


.SH m605x 

.PP
This driver connects with the 6051 or 6050 devices from Marklin connected
via the serial port. An USB2Serial converter should work fine. The serial
line settings are fixed to 2400 8N2 and cannot be changed.

.TP
m6020mode
In this mode the srcpd does not sent the 4 functions. This
is a feature of the 6021 only.

.TP
p_time
This is the time the driver code waits until it recognized the input
change in milliseconds. This feature may support a debounce found in
the hardware.

.TP
ga_min_activetime
The time in milliseconds a GA device needs to be in active state. The
absolute minimum is 75 ms and is needed for stable communication with
the 6051.

.TP
pause_between_commands
This is the time between two commands the drivers must wait. The exact
values should be hand tuned. If the system does not respond or drops
commands try to increase this value. Default is 200 (milliseconds).

.TP
pause_between_bytes
This is the time the driver waits between 2 bytes in multi-byte commands.
The hardware handshake does not work with all devices so this parameter
was introduced to support it. The default is 2 (milliseconds)

.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA. This parameter does not have a real effect
since the interface supports the addresses 1...256 only. Keep the
default untouched.

.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address. Since this
number is limited to 80, keep the default untouched.

.TP
number_fb
This is the number of 6088 modules attached to the 6051/6050 device. 
It can be as large as 31. The default is 0 (no modules are attached).
Please note that 6088 modules attached to other devices (memory)
cannot be accessed.

.SH loopback

.PP
This bus does not connect to real hardware. It is used primarily
for development tasks but may be useful for real installations too.
Every command on this bus does only have an echo effect on the INFO
sessions. The devices may be used as virtual devices for communication
tasks.

.TP
number_ga
This is the number of GA devices. Default is 256.

.TP
number_gl
Like the number of GA this number gives the maximum address.
Default is 80

.TP
number_fb
This is the number of feedback devices. Default is 0 (no device).
